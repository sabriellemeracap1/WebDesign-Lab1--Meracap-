# What is a website, and how is it different from a web application? 

A website is mainly built to present information. It is like an online brochure or a digital bulletin board. You visit it to read, browse, or learn something, but you don’t really interact much beyond clicking and scrolling. A web application, on the other hand, is designed for interaction. It responds to what you do, whether that’s logging in, submitting forms, editing content, or making transactions. In simple terms, websites are for viewing, while web applications are for doing.

# Why do you think organizations (like office or schools) need websites?

Organizations such as offices and schools benefit from having their own websites because it allows them to be accessible to the public at any time and from any location. A website serves as a reliable source of information, helping people stay informed about services, announcements, and updates without needing to visit in person. It also reflects professionalism and builds trust by providing a consistent and convenient way to connect with the organization.

# What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?

As someone who was unfamiliar with GitHub, creating my first repository presented several challenges. Navigating the platform for the first time was confusing, especially when trying to locate specific features and understand the interface. I found myself overwhelmed by the number of unfamiliar terms, buttons, and characters on the screen, which made the process feel more technical than expected.

# How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?

Writing a README helps make future projects more organized and easier to understand. It gives a clear overview of what the project is about, how it works, and what others need to know. This makes it easier to explain your work, especially when working with a team or looking back at it later. It also shows professionalism and helps avoid confusion.
